# Computing the general equilibrium of the static model in Acemoglu & Restrepo (2018) "The Race Between Man and Machine".

For simplictiy, I've adopted Acemoglu & Restrepo's 'Assumption 2', which states that $\eta=0$ and $\bar{B}=1$.

## Running the code: 
Clone the repositiory and run main.py. This will create a plot like the one shown below. The plot displays the equilibrium wage (W), capital rental rate (R), labor employment (L), and production (Y). The plot is of Figure 3 in Acemoglu & Restrepo's paper.
